## Welcome to the ["_DGamboa Notes & Snippets_" ][C&S] repository!

Here, I document my journey through the fascinating world of software development, Python programming, Docker containers, Linux administration, 3D printing, IoT home automation, and various other intriguing technologies.

As I explore these fields, I collect valuable insights, code snippets, and notes to aid my learning process and share with the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, I hope you find something useful here.

**Get Involved**:

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository, fork it, and contribute back! Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly valued and appreciated.

Happy coding!
